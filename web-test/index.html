  <p>
    I'm finishing up my bachelor's degree in computer science at The University
    of Texas at Tyler. I'm [soon to be] married to my best friend (who is also
    the
    <a href="https://instagram.com/mmperkinsartist">most talented woman</a>). I
    play ultimate frisbee, read, and enjoy spending time with family.
  </p>
  <p><strong>A broad worldview is important to me</strong></p>
  <p>
    Growing up in Papua New Guinea, North Carolina, Cameroon, Texas, Austria,
    and places in between, I find myself looking forward to opportunities to see
    more of the world. I'm enthralled by variety, from the cultures and
    landscapes to the individual people I get to meet. I look forward to each
    adventure I get to share with my traveling partner (yeah, the same amazing
    woman above).
  </p>
  <p><strong>I strive to do things well.</strong></p>
  <p>
    Regardless of the situation, I work so that I can be proud of what I
    accomplished. I like to work efficiently, and avoid devoting my time to
    things that aren't useful. I enjoy solving problems, so my interest in
    programming follows naturally. Supplementing my courses, I've learned a lot
    from my two older brothers,
    <a href="https://ansonvandoren.com">Anson</a> and
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-vandoren-5b288841/">Tim</a>.

  <h3>Sky Smuggler</h3>
  <p>
    I've spent time working with my brothers on building a trading-based game,
    <a href="https://skysmuggler.com">Sky Smuggler</a>. I've gained experience
    working with Javascript and React, and Python. This is the first large
    project I've been a part of, and it was pretty cool when the project
    structure clicked. I've specifically enjoyed working on the backend/game
    mechanics stuff. The value of test driven development became apparent to me
    in the course of this project, especially as we add more new features to the
    game.
  </p>
  <h3>Android Development</h3>
  <p>
    One of my recent classes, "Modern Programming," dealt heavily with Android
    development. Through this, I became familiar using Android Studio and
    Firebase (authentication, database, and storage). From this experience, I've
    found myself to be more interested in developing web apps than native apps.

    I've always enjoyed heights, and I like to do work that makes a difference.
    Pairing these with a love of Stihl's

    leaf blower (seriously, it's amazing) and the need to find work that fits in
    around taking classes, I started cleaning out gutters in the summer of 2018.
    Since then, I've had experience cleaning gutters and rooftops on numerous
    building types: residential homes, industrial buildings, entire apartment
    complexes, and everything in between. I have the necessary experience,
    ropes, and equipment for multi-story and other more difficult cleans. I
    offer free quotes, and am generally able to provide service within a few
    days of being contacted. Fill out the form below to contact me, and I'll get
    back to you as soon as I can!
