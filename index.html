  <p>
    I'm finishing up my bachelor's degree in computer science at The University
    of Texas at Tyler. I'm married to my best friend (who is also the
    <a href="https://instagram.com/madivandoren" target="_blank"
      >most talented woman</a
    >). I play ultimate frisbee, read, and enjoy spending time with family.
  </p>
  <p><strong>A broad worldview is important to me</strong></p>
  <p>
    Growing up in Papua New Guinea, North Carolina, Cameroon, Texas, Austria,
    and places in between, I find myself looking forward to opportunities to see
    more of the world. I'm enthralled by variety, from the cultures and
    landscapes to the individual people I get to meet. I look forward to each
    adventure I get to share with my traveling partner (yeah, the same amazing
    woman above).
  </p>
  <p><strong>I strive to do things well.</strong></p>
  <p>
    Regardless of the situation, I work so that I can be proud of what I
    accomplished. I like to work efficiently, and avoid devoting my time to
    things that aren't useful. I enjoy solving problems, so my interest in
    programming follows naturally. Supplementing my courses, I've learned a lot
    from my two older brothers,
    <a href="https://ansonvandoren.com" target="_blank">Anson</a> and
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-vandoren-5b288841/" target="_blank"
      >Tim</a
    >.

  <h3>Graduation Timer</h3>
  <p>
    A bit of a spur-of-the-moment project, I created
    <a href="https://daysuntilgraduation.com" target="_blank"
      >daysuntilgraduation.com</a
    >
    so that I could easily check how much time I had remaining in my final
    semester here at UT Tyler. I built the timer functionality for the site
    using <a href="https://moment.github.io/luxon/" target="_blank">Luxon</a>,
    which made implementing cross-timezone functionality <em>much</em> easier.
    Overall a fun project, and a good reminder to use libraries where applicable
    instead of attempting to reinvent the wheel.
  </p>
  <h3>Free Invoice Generator</h3>
  <p>
    I'm in the process of building a
    <a href="free-document-generator.com/invoice" target="_blank"
      >web service</a
    >
    to generate downloadable PDF invoices. With a focus on ease of use and a
    minimalistic design, the goal of this service is to allow small business
    owners to quickly and easily create customer invoices.

  <!-- TODO: write more after finishing the project -->
  <h3>Sky Smuggler</h3>
  <p>
    I've spent time working with my brothers on building a trading-based game,
    <a href="https://skysmuggler.com" target="_blank">Sky Smuggler</a>. I've
    gained experience working with Javascript and React, and Python. This is the
    first large project I've been a part of, and it was pretty cool when the
    project structure clicked. I've specifically enjoyed working on the
    backend/game mechanics stuff. The value of test driven development became
    apparent to me in the course of this project, especially as we add more new
    features to the game.

    I've always enjoyed heights, and I like to do work that makes a difference.

    leaf blower (seriously, it's amazing) and the need to find work that fits in
    around taking classes, I started cleaning out gutters in the summer of 2018.
    Since then, I've had experience cleaning gutters and rooftops on numerous
    building types: residential homes, industrial buildings, entire apartment
    complexes, and everything in between. I have the necessary experience,
    ropes, and equipment for multi-story and other more difficult cleans. I
    offer free quotes, and am generally able to provide service within a few
    days of being contacted. Fill out the form below to contact me, and I'll get
    back to you as soon as I can!
