    <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm finishing up my bachelor's degree in computer science at The
      University of Texas at Tyler. I'm married to my best friend (who is also
      the
      <a href="https://instagram.com/madivandoren" target="_blank"
        >most talented woman</a
      >). I play ultimate frisbee, read, and enjoy spending time with family.
    </p>
    <p><strong>A broad worldview is important to me</strong></p>
    <p>
      Growing up in Papua New Guinea, North Carolina, Cameroon, Texas, Austria,
      and places in between, I find myself looking forward to opportunities to
      see more of the world. I'm enthralled by variety, from the cultures and
      landscapes to the individual people I get to meet. I look forward to each
      adventure I get to share with my traveling partner (yeah, the same amazing
      woman above).
    </p>
    <p><strong>I strive to do things well.</strong></p>
    <p>
      Regardless of the situation, I work so that I can be proud of what I
      accomplished. I like to work efficiently, and avoid devoting my time to
      things that aren't useful. I enjoy solving problems, so my interest in
      programming follows naturally. Supplementing my courses, I've learned a
      lot from my two older brothers,
      <a href="https://ansonvandoren.com" target="_blank">Anson</a> and
      <a
        href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-vandoren-5b288841/"
        target="_blank"
        >Tim</a
      >.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>Graduation Timer</h3>
    <p>
      A bit of a spur-of-the-moment project, I created
      <a href="https://daysuntilgraduation.com" target="_blank"
        >daysuntilgraduation.com</a
      >
      so that I could easily check how much time I had remaining in my final
      semester here at UT Tyler. I built the timer functionality for the site
      using <a href="https://moment.github.io/luxon/" target="_blank">Luxon</a>,
      which made implementing cross-timezone functionality <em>much</em> easier.
      Overall a fun project, and a good reminder to use libraries where
      applicable instead of attempting to reinvent the wheel.
    </p>
    <h3>Free Invoice Generator</h3>
    <!-- TODO: write more after finishing the project -->
    <p>
      I'm in the process of building a
      <a href="https://free-document-generator.com/invoice" target="_blank"
        >web service</a
      >
      to generate downloadable PDF invoices. With a focus on ease of use and a
      minimalistic design, the goal of this service is to allow small business
      owners to quickly and easily create customer invoices.
    </p>
    <h3>Sky Smuggler</h3>
    <p>
      I've spent time working with my brothers on building a trading-based game,
      <a href="https://skysmuggler.com" target="_blank">Sky Smuggler</a>. I've
      gained experience working with Javascript and React, and Python. This is
      the first large project I've been a part of, and it was pretty cool when
      the project structure clicked. I've specifically enjoyed working on the
      backend/game mechanics stuff. The value of test driven development became
      apparent to me in the course of this project, especially as we add more
      new features to the game.
